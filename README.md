# Flight Physics Takeoff Simulator
A physics based Aircraft takeoff simulator to emulate the velocity, acceleration, and alititude of an aircraft in its first 10 seconds of travel!

The simulation includes the core 4 aerodynamical forces that are met on an aircraft such as drag, lift, gravity, and thrust. 

Currently the simulation provides a simple velocity estimation along with an altitude over 10 seconds of travel. Work is being put into this project to optimize flight patterns of least energy and expanding beyond the 10 second threshold. Hope you enjoy!
